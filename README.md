#  Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project demonstrates how to build an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies images into categories based on features learned from the data.

##  What the Project Does

- Loads and processes image data using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Builds a CNN with layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Dropout`, and `Dense`.
- Trains the model and plots training vs. validation accuracy and loss.
- Tests the trained model on new images for prediction.
